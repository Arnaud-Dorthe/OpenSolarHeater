Construction and Installation guidelines toward a Solar Heater Made of disposable packaging

3.1-Step by step in building the solar collector
The solar collector is the component that deserves special attention, being the same, is directly responsible for
performance of a solar heating system.
Our solar collector differs from the conventional, in terms of materials used in its construction and thermal
efficiency, because as a matter of lowering costs, we use the columns to absorb heat, PVC pipe less efficient than
the copper tubes used in collectors conventional market, while limiting the temperature to levels that maintain the
rigidity of PVC, without causing the softening of these, and consequently, undermine the structure of the solar
heater on the upper part, causing leaks.
Without forgetting the box or container, if they are of materials with the temperature limits for accumulation.
PET bottles and tetra pak cartons fit properly, are the role of the box, the absorption of solar panel and glass in
conventional collectors, which is designed to both protect the inside of the collector of external interference,
especially the winds and variations of temperature, creating the greenhouse effect. Although simple, it contains
details required in the process. For example:
3.1.1-Choice of pet bottles, and what size and cut them
Three are the bottles we use in the construction of it, by giving preference to the transparent (glass) in the
formation of columns of thermal absorption: Lisas bottles, belts and bottles of Coke and Pepsi (new model).
We use the green bottle just for the cutting of strips in different moorings, described throughout the manual.
To facilitate the cutting of bottles (glass), we suggest a simple template, or cut 2 pieces of PVC pipe 100 mm: 1 to
29 cm and the other with 31 cm and then make a cut lengthwise in 2 tubes, allowing the placing the bottle in it,
defining the size of the cylinder to be cut.
The pipe of 29 cm used for measuring the cutting of Lisas and bottles of Pepsi (new model) and the tube of 31 cm
only for the cutting of bottles of Coke.
Suggestions: after consumption of soda, rinse the bottle and let drain. Bote in the refrigerator for 2 min without the
lid and take it to cover the fridge quickly. As the air inside the bottle back to the room temperature increases the
volume, remains the same with the original format, eliminating the risk that, when stored in cool place,
self-kneading it.
If you have a few bottles, and some mashed them and if you want to take advantage of them, destampe it and add
100 ml of cold water, cover it and take the micro wave for 45 seconds, remove from oven and immediately turn it
in horizontal by some 10 seconds, then leave it standing and then carefully desenrosque the cap slowly to release

the steam, leaving the cool bottle without the cap. But the question is: why not use hot water?
Because the bottle without the pressure of steam and support, to receive the hot water is all deformed.
Note: this operation seeks to protect itself goggle, gloves, coat, and place far enough from other people, especially
children.
3.1.2-boxes of 1 liter Tetra Pak (milk, juices, etc.).
Tetra pak boxes have in their composition, 5% aluminum, 20% polyethylene and 75% of cellulose, which makes
their collection and only role, thus requiring special equipment for separation of such materials.
There are few companies specialized in this process, which discourages the collectors, although the campaigns
leading manufacturer (July/2004 Superinteressante Magazine, page 79). The application of them in our project
offers excellent results, since the combination of such materials, avoids the bend in the temperature that will be
submitted to the contrary is to use paper.
For a perfect fit inside the bottles of Coke or the Lisas, cut the box with 23 cm, and the bottles of Pepsi (new
model) with 20 cm in length (Fig.1), with 1 cut-over 7 cm at the bottom of the box in both sizes (Fig.2), will fit the
neck of the next bottle.
There just fold it in a simple way, using the lateral bending of the same (Fig.3), and two diagonal folds in on top
(Fig.4), which will follow the curvature of the bottle top, act as support to sustain the housing. We paint it with
matte black synthetic enamel paint drying quickly to external and internal, used to iron, wood, etc., But avoid
buying into spray, it is very expensive to paint rather than cans of 1kg.
Note: Do not use ink to glow, as will the performance of the collector, since the sun will be partly reflected.

3.1.3-cutting, painting the pipes, and assembly of the collector
The reason we use a maximum of 5 bottles per column, is not to hinder the installation of the collector in relation
to the height of the water box or reservoir, as discussed in Section 2.1 by end-Movement siphon, because here in
the south of the country requires that is greater inclination on the grounds of local latitude.
Mentioned as an example Tubar√£o-SC., Where I live, the latitude is 28.3 o S, while in Brasilia, the latitude is 15.5 o
S.
Back into the 4-item topics relating to the installation of the assembly.
In our project we use the collector tubes and connections of the type I 20 mm weldable quality of good quality,
with the size of the tubes of the columns depending on the type and number of cylinders. Remember that before
cutting the tubes of the columns, check the types of bottles available, because the ideal is to choose, choose one
type for each collector, here is the measure that best fits:
92 cm for columns with 4-cylinder straight
To 101-cm columns with 5 bottles of Pepsi waist (mod. new)
108 cm-to columns with 5 bottles of Coca
Note: The design of the bottle of Coca new (yellow cover) has changed, so
to maintain the size of the column, merge with Pepsi (mod.novo)

Before painting the tubes of the columns with the same ink used in the boxes, we must isolate with duct tape the 2
ends approximately 2 cm, after which it is painted cut the ribbon due to the type you plug in the connections.
The tubes of distance between columns should be 8.5 cm and without paint, standard measurement for all
collectors, no matter the types of bottles.
The assembly becomes simple to follow an order to put the components, taking care to use the adhesive only in the
tubes and connections, the top of the collector where the hot water circulates. At the bottom should just fit them
with the help of a rubber hammer, making the maintenance, if necessary, just undocked the bar lower, without
compromising the size of the columns, as if cut would be cut, and the loss of all connections and hoses away.
Recalling: to avoid leaks, the quality of the pipes and connections is essential. Watch out, the cheap comes out
expensive.
To simplify the assembly of solar collector, we need to glue the three pieces of Fig.1, repeating the operation in
the number of columns of solar collector. Conjuntinho Cole one another to form the 5 columns. Then insert the
bottles and tetra pak cartons (fig.2) in 5 columns, not forgetting to close the last bottle of each column, cutting
off another bottle, but on top of the side cover. In conclusion, the fit of the bus below (Fig.4), closing this module.
We recommend for cold regions, is shown to fill the bottom, between the bottle and box tetra pak (Fig.3), with
some isothermal not absorb moisture (eg plastic labels, plastic bags).
The reason to opt for modules of 5 columns, it is about management, because it is extremely easy to upload it to
the location of installation. Amend a module to another, until five at most, to avoid tension on buses.
According to Fig.5, we should seal the 1st bottle of each column, with strips of rubber (eg inner tubes) or tape auto
merger. This prevents the escape of heat from inside the column, and prevent the wind turn the cylinders, taking
the position of Tetra Pak cartons, which is upwards, avoiding loss in income.
In Fig.6, only two speakers, 4 cylinder straight up.
For better viewing, set up to follow, step by step with pictures, part of 2 columns of solar collector:
Fig.1 Fig.2 Fig.3
Fig.4 Fig.5 Fig.6
Box 3.2-or water reservoir
Even the water box on the site may be used in the supply of hot and cold water, since it has a minimum capacity of
500 liters, to make available more or less than 250 liters of hot water, since we use as reservoir the upper half of
the box for the solar heating system. The ideal and recommended, it would be a reservoir for hot water only, with
the size corresponding to the daily number of people, and near points of consumption to avoid waste, until it
reaches the hot water tank.
Since the shell is responsible to collect the hot water, it is necessary a good thermal insulation, which is found in
conventional batteries market, where use is high-efficiency vacuum.
These batteries have the majority of heating aid for rainy days or covert, with electricity or gas, controlled by
thermostats that trigger the feature where the water temperature is below the pre-set by the user.

Our design for the character to make it economically viable for all, has no such recourse, and the shower has been
replaced by common, but with the use of an electronic controller for adjusting the temperature, connected in series
with the input electric energy of the shower.
Common market, it facilitates the adjustment of the ideal temperature for bathing, without the need to vary the
flow of water in the registry.
The use of basic materials available in all regions, is of extreme importance. Applied in the project a plastic box as
a reservoir of 250 liters, but that does not indicate that boxes of other materials are released, but be very careful
and not use containers that contain chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, etc. because even well-washed
contaminated and continue offering the potential risks to health. So to avoid inconvenience, being sure of the
origin of them.
3.3-Thermal insulation of the box or container
As the thermal insulation has many options: from the Styrofoam as we found in several packages of supermarkets,
such that comes with cold (ex.com cheese, ham, etc.). And in appliances and electronics, also plastic bags, papers,
as an alternative for those who live in urban areas. In other regions we have great vacuum, such as: sawdust, wheat
hulls, rice husks, dry grass, etc.., But no humidity.
It is extremely easy the use of such insulation, filling boxes of 1 liter tetra pak (without leaving empty spaces),
closing them again, resulting in each box isothermal block. You set these blocks in the box reservoir or use glue or
tape, and finally the way you feel better, taking care to fill the spaces between the boxes, when set in round
containers or rounded corners, with plastic bags, papers, etc. ..
Vale warn that if the box or container is outdoors, you should have protection against the weather, or otherwise the
insulation will be damaged.
As the replacement of cold water is at the bottom of the box or shell, no insulation is required at that location.
Another type of insulation simple and effective but more expensive, is to put a box of water within a compartment
made of wood, bricks, or even inside another larger box, enough to take a break on the side of at least 6 cm, due to
filling with any of the insulation above, not forgetting that it is mandatory to isolate the cover of the box.
Apply the thermal insulation, only after all the holes and connections necessary for the installation of assembly.
4-topics relating to the installation of all
4.1-dimensional system as the consumption of the country and region
When put into practice the project in October 2002, built a solar collector with 100 pet bottles, 100 boxes of 1 liter
tetra pak, arranged in 25 columns with 4 bottles each, totaling a floor area of absorption of 1.80 m 2, and a plastic
box of 250 liters in the role of shell, coated with polystyrene of 20 mm. It is noteworthy that the thickness of
insulation is not sufficient to maintain or store the hot water until late at night.
As installed almost summer, and that with the sun around 6 hours, heats the water to 52 o C, being necessary to
mix with cold water.
But to reach the winter, the temperature of cold water in the box Shark, is around 13 to 16 o C, against 22 to 25 o C
in summer, and that due to the difference between the seasons, in addition to the reduction of solar radiation in
winter, the thermal efficiency drops from 52 o C in summer to a maximum of 38 o C in winter.
To correct the problem, we built another collector with the same dimensions of the former, on sunny days to meet
the normal consumption of 4 people. But for the summer we will increase the reservoir to 500 liters, or disable
part of the collectors to prevent overheating. Important: install the collectors independent of each other, to
facilitate a possible maintenance.
For those who have, or may install a box or container with a volume equal to or higher than required, a very
interesting and simple solution to find the temperature and volume of hot water, s that meets their needs for
consumption, is to installing the outlet of cold water to the solar collector as low as possible. Attach the flange to
the inside of the box or container, 1 adapter as internal flange, and 1 curve of 90 ¬∞ with 2 pieces of pipe at its ends,
setting 1 of the adapter tubes without adhesive, and the other serves to increase the options for regulation (P√°g.5,
diagram 1, item 7 - Fisherman rotating), as by rotating the set, you varies and determines the amount and
temperature of water to be heated according to season. Note: Option great a prototype in a laboratory school
experiences.
Considering the above, we suggest that each is the size next to the needs of consumption of each home, each

project requires the observation of various factors, and among them:
Examples: 1) position of the solar collector in relation to geographic north
2) inclination of the solar collector on the latitude
3) Region and place to be installed
Note: To find the latitude you need, or live, visit the website:
www.aondefica.com
On the holes to be made in cash or reservoir, we suggest
simply as references in percentage of the height of the box:
4.2-Support for fixing the solar collector
It is at the discretion of each of the material to be used as support for fixing the solar collector, but indicated that at
least the two buses are tied to bars of 3‚ÅÑ4 galvanized pipe, or something to ensure the alignment of the collector
Important: to avoid air bubbles hinder the movement of water in the collector, you need a gap of 2 cm for every
meter run, and never leave the buses curves.
Important note: never leave water in the collector fails, at risk of overheating and destruction of it.
Check the chart:
Digraph 3
If you want to set straight on the roof without taking into account the local latitude, should install the solar
collector with at least 10 and inclination toward the geographic north as close as possible, and that will increase
the absorption area of solar panels, increasing the collector to compensate for the loss of placements.
It is appropriate to emphasize that almost all the problems of thermal efficiency of a solar heater, cease to exist as
we approach the north and northeast.

To give a preference by the end of movement by crane, it is mandatory that the bottom of the box or heat reservoir,
is always up on the top of the solar collector (as per item 2.1 Movement-term siphon), which lies to each choose
the best alternative for the site, without forgetting that the talk about housing or shell, we are talking about weight,
so again, do not improvise in questionable places that may collapse and cause serious problems. (Remember that
each liter of water weighs 1 kilo)
4.3-Thermal insulation of the ducts above the collector, by the box or container
Engage the bus's top collector and hot water pipe leading to the box with styrofoam, tying it to the tubes with strips
cut from pet bottle green. Note: The polystyrene does not stand for a long time exposed to the sun.
4.4-Distance between the collector and the box or container
The closest possible in order to minimize thermal losses while taking into account also the distances of the points
of consumption, thus avoiding the waste until the water hot.
4.5-blender with hot water / cold, simple, but practical
The site to be deployed the solar heating system, have facilities for hot and cold water, only requires connection to
carry the box or tank, the installation of hot water.
Where the water supply of the property is only with cold water, we suggest a mixer simple and efficient, built with
PVC pipes and connections, indicated for the shower, but with some modifications, can integrate the other points
of consumption in the home, such as kitchen, tank, toilet.
The diagram below details the mixer in an objective:

4.6-Installation of electronic control of temperature to electric shower
The reasons for the installation of electronic control to the electric shower, were described in item (3.2-Box or
water tank).
As for the layout of links to electronic control, there are different market models and brands, containing all the

installation instructions.
4.7-Time of exposure to solar with thermal efficiency
The solar heater on sunny days, the maximum temperature reached after 6 hours, but from 10 hours of the
morning, we started to notice the increase in water temperature of the housing or shell.
Even in days covert, but not rainy and depending on the region, can provide satisfactory performance and
economy of partial power.
